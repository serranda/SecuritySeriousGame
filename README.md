# Security Serious Game
The aim is to develop a serious game focused on the internet security

The game will be a Sim-like game, in which the user will assume the role of a supervisor of a SCADA system.
His job is to prevent attack to the SCADA system, by adopting the right countermeasures and behaviours. 
A point system will determine if the job will be done in the right way.
 
During the game, will be provided a series of useful information related to the Security of SCADA Systems, in order to teach these arguments to the final users. 
 
 
# Repository Organization
 
In this repository will be stored all the files produced during the developing of the game/thesis.
 
The folder "Documentation" contains all the files which describe the general structure of the game, as well as the gameplay. They will be udpated if necessary.

The folder "SimSCADA" is the Unity project folder, with all the script used for the game.

In the folder "Thesis" are stored the .pdf files of the final thesis and all the related LaTeX files.

N.B.
All the documentation produced, except for this README, at the moment is only in Italian.
